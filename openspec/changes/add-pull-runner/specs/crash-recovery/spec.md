## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Claim boundaries
The launch lifecycle SHALL gain the durable state `claimable`, entered after the worktree and brief exist in `pull` and `mixed` modes; a parked launch whose window elapses SHALL move through `launching` and `live` as a spawned launch does. The claim's external effect is its response. Its durable record SHALL be one transaction that sets the launch to `live` with the worker id, resets the lease, and appends the event, committed before the response is sent, and a lost response SHALL be repaired by the idempotent re-claim. The named crash points SHALL additionally include `launch.afterClaimable`, after the row becomes claimable, and `claim.afterRecord`, after the claim transaction and before the response. On start, recovery SHALL keep a `claimable` launch claimable, verifying that its worktree exists and re-preparing it when missing; SHALL keep a live launch held by a worker while its lease is unexpired, judging liveness by the lease rather than by a process; and SHALL fail an expired one with reason `leaseExpired`. Sweeps SHALL treat claimable launches as live. The convergence invariants SHALL hold for the crash matrix run in `pull` mode with scripted workers.

#### Scenario: Crash after the claim record
- **WHEN** the daemon dies at `claim.afterRecord` and the worker claims again with the same worker id after the restart
- **THEN** it receives the same launch and token, and the run converges with one trailer commit per task

#### Scenario: Crash after claimable
- **WHEN** the daemon dies at `launch.afterClaimable` and restarts
- **THEN** the launch is still claimable with its worktree present and is claimed normally

#### Scenario: Claimable launch with a missing worktree
- **WHEN** a claimable launch's worktree has been deleted while the daemon was down
- **THEN** recovery re-prepares the worktree and brief for the same launch and it stays claimable

#### Scenario: Claimed launch survives a restart
- **WHEN** the daemon restarts while a worker holds a launch with an unexpired lease
- **THEN** the launch stays live without a pid and the worker's next call succeeds
