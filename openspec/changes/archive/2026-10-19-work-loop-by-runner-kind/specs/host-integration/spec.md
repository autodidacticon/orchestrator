## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Codex host
`hosts/codex/` SHALL let a Codex session be the operator. It SHALL ship `bin/orchestrator.mjs`, the dependency-free launcher of "Plugin launcher" resolving its host directory from its own URL, whose npx fallback is pinned to the version of the published package in `hosts/codex/package.json`. It SHALL NOT read `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. `hosts/codex/package.json` SHALL be private, named for the host and not for the package, and SHALL have the published package as its only dependency, pinned to the exact version the Claude Code plugin pins. `hosts/codex/node_modules` SHALL be ignored by git.

`hosts/codex/config.toml` SHALL be the registration template. It SHALL declare `[mcp_servers.orchestrator_operator]` with `command = "node"`, `args` set to the launcher and `mcp`, `startup_timeout_sec = 30`, and a `tool_timeout_sec` of at least `ceil(WAIT_CAP_MS / 1000) + 30`. The id SHALL use an underscore, so the tools are `mcp__orchestrator_operator__<tool>`.

`hosts/codex/README.md` SHALL document the template block as the primary install. It SHALL document `codex mcp add orchestrator_operator --env ORCH_WAIT_CAP_MS=<ms below 60000> -- node <hosts/codex>/bin/orchestrator.mjs mcp` as the alternative for a registration that keeps Codex's 60-second default tool timeout. It SHALL document verification with `codex mcp get orchestrator_operator`, and the approval keys `codex exec` needs.

`hosts/codex/skills/` SHALL hold `import`, `run`, and `review` skills, named `orchestrator-import`, `orchestrator-run`, and `orchestrator-review`, with the behaviour of "Skills" except as follows. They SHALL NOT reference `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. They SHALL have no Workflow or subagent section and SHALL name no Claude model as a default. They SHALL look for the test command in `AGENTS.md`, with `CLAUDE.md` only as the fallback when there is no `AGENTS.md`. Their toolchain line SHALL always name the runner kind. When no daemon is running and `orchestrator.yaml` sets no `runner.mode`, they SHALL call `start` with `mode: "spawn"`, so that the daemon runs the agents headless; otherwise they SHALL call `start` without `mode`, because an explicit mode overrides the file and is applied to a running daemon. When the mode in force is `pull` or `mixed` they SHALL say so, SHALL name the work loop (`orchestrator-work`, "Work loop by runner kind") as the way codex launches are worked in those modes, and SHALL offer `spawn` unless another session holds launches of the run. They SHALL say that under `codex exec` the operator tools run only when approvals are pre-granted (`approval_policy = "never"`, `default_tools_approval_mode = "approve"`, and per-tool `approval_mode = "approve"`), and that an interactive session prompts instead. The `import` skill SHALL name the Codex form of the tracker connectors' tools (`mcp__linear__`, `mcp__atlassian__`).

#### Scenario: operator server registers and its tools answer in a Codex session
- **WHEN** `codex exec` runs with `mcp_servers.orchestrator_operator` set as in `hosts/codex/config.toml` and every operator tool pre-approved, and is asked to start a run, import a graph of scripted tasks, answer its question, and wait
- **THEN** its `mcp_tool_call` items name server `orchestrator_operator`, `start` reports mode `spawn`, and a `wait` result reports `finished: true`

#### Scenario: Registration verified
- **WHEN** the template block is in a Codex config and `codex mcp get orchestrator_operator` is run
- **THEN** it lists the server as enabled over stdio with command `node`, the launcher and `mcp` as args, `startup_timeout_sec: 30`, and a `tool_timeout_sec` above the `wait` cap by at least thirty seconds

#### Scenario: Launcher pinned by the host package
- **WHEN** `hosts/codex` is copied outside any checkout without `node_modules` and its launcher runs with `ORCH_LAUNCHER_DRY_RUN` set and `mcp`
- **THEN** it prints source `npx` with `--package=<name>@<the version in hosts/codex/package.json>` and `orchestrator-mcp`

#### Scenario: Test command from AGENTS.md
- **WHEN** `start` returns `needsConfig: ["checkCommand"]` in a Codex session and `AGENTS.md` says "run tests with `make check`"
- **THEN** the `orchestrator-run` skill calls `configure` with `checkCommand: "make check"` and reports that it took the command from `AGENTS.md`

### Requirement: OpenCode host
`hosts/opencode/` SHALL let an OpenCode session be the operator. It SHALL ship `bin/orchestrator.mjs`, the third copy of the launcher of "Plugin launcher", whose npx fallback is pinned to the version of the published package in `hosts/opencode/package.json`. `hosts/opencode/package.json` SHALL be private, named for the host and not for the package, and SHALL have the published package as its only dependency, pinned to the exact version the Claude Code plugin pins. `hosts/opencode/node_modules` SHALL be ignored by git.

`hosts/opencode/opencode.json` SHALL be the registration snippet. It SHALL declare `mcp.orchestrator_operator` with `type: "local"`, `command` set to `node`, the launcher, and `mcp`, and a per-server `timeout` in milliseconds above `WAIT_CAP_MS + 30000` (180000), because OpenCode cuts an MCP call at 60 seconds by default and the per-server `timeout` is the only cap opencode 1.18.30 honours. It SHALL have no `mcp.timeout` block, which 1.18.30 drops with a compatibility diagnostic. OpenCode names the tools `<id>_<tool>`, so they are `orchestrator_operator_<tool>`.

`hosts/opencode/README.md` SHALL document merging the snippet into `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` or a project's `opencode.json` as the primary install, and `opencode mcp add orchestrator_operator --env ORCH_WAIT_CAP_MS=<ms below 60000> -- node <hosts/opencode>/bin/orchestrator.mjs mcp` as the alternative, which cannot set `timeout`. It SHALL document verification with `opencode mcp list`, the skills install, the plugin, the start-mode rule, and that the attachment ends when OpenCode closes the server's stdio. It SHALL have a pull-mode section documenting `orchestrator-work --runner opencode --workers 2`, run from a checkout as `node <hosts/codex>/bin/work.mjs --runner opencode`, and SHALL say that a `startupContended` start under `dataDir: shared` is released for relaunch.

`hosts/opencode/skills/` SHALL hold `import`, `run`, and `review` skills named `orchestrator-import`, `orchestrator-run`, and `orchestrator-review`. Each SHALL be the Codex host's edition with the tool prefix `mcp__orchestrator_operator__` replaced by `orchestrator_operator_`, the host name changed, and only these blocks rewritten: the operator tools' permissions in place of Codex approvals (under `opencode run` a tool whose permission is `ask` is rejected automatically, and the remedy is `"orchestrator_operator_*": "allow"`), the OpenCode form of the tracker connectors (`mcp.linear` and `mcp.atlassian` entries whose tools are `linear_<tool>` and `atlassian_<tool>`), the per-server `timeout` in place of `tool_timeout_sec`, the toolchain line and kind lists naming `opencode` (its permission and commit policy), and the pull-mode offer. A host test SHALL hold the two editions to exactly those differences. Because an OpenCode session has no session workers, the skills SHALL call `start` with `mode: "spawn"` when no daemon is running and `orchestrator.yaml` sets no `runner.mode`, and without `mode` otherwise. When the mode in force is `pull` or `mixed` they SHALL say so and SHALL offer `spawn` unless another session holds launches of the run. When the run holds `opencode` launches they SHALL also offer the work loop that `modeNote` names (`orchestrator-work --runner opencode`, "Work loop by runner kind"), started from a shell.

`hosts/opencode/plugins/orchestrator.js` SHALL be the session plugin, installed by linking it into `~/.config/opencode/plugins/` (or a project's `.opencode/plugins/`). It SHALL export exactly one function, since OpenCode calls every exported function as a plugin. It SHALL find `hooks/session-start.mjs` beside its own real path, or under `ORCH_OPENCODE_HOST` for a copied install. On `session.created` for a session without a `parentID` it SHALL run the script once with `node` and a ten-second timeout. On that session's first `chat.message` it SHALL append the script's line to the user's existing text part, SHALL never push a new part (OpenCode refuses a part without ids), and SHALL leave the message untouched when the script printed nothing. It SHALL show the line through `client.tui.showToast` and SHALL ignore a client without a TUI. It SHALL NOT use `experimental.chat.system.transform`. `hosts/opencode/hooks/` SHALL hold byte copies of the Claude Code plugin's `session-start.mjs` and `session-end.mjs`; nothing runs the end script, since OpenCode has no session end event and the operator server ends its own attachment when its stdio closes. Worker launches pass `--pure` and never load the plugin.

#### Scenario: OpenCode registration verified
- **WHEN** `OPENCODE_CONFIG` names the snippet with `<hosts/opencode>` filled in and `opencode mcp list` is run
- **THEN** it reports `orchestrator_operator` as `connected` with the launcher command

#### Scenario: operator server answers in an OpenCode session
- **WHEN** `opencode run` runs with the snippet as its config and is asked to call `orchestrator_operator_start` with `mode: "spawn"`
- **THEN** its `tool_use` event names `orchestrator_operator_start`, completed, and the result reports `mode: "spawn"`

#### Scenario: Skill editions held in step
- **WHEN** the Codex edition of a skill is changed in a block the OpenCode edition shares
- **THEN** the host test fails until the OpenCode edition carries the same change

#### Scenario: Notice appended once
- **WHEN** the plugin sees `session.created` and then two `chat.message` calls for that session while a run needs attention
- **THEN** the first message's text part ends with the start line, the second is untouched, and one toast shows the line

#### Scenario: Nothing needs attention
- **WHEN** the plugin runs with an `ORCH_HOME` that holds no run
- **THEN** the user's message part is unchanged and no toast is shown

### Requirement: Work loop by runner kind
The Codex host SHALL ship `hosts/codex/bin/work.mjs`, also the package executable `orchestrator-work`; it is the work loop of the Codex and OpenCode hosts. It SHALL depend only on node built-ins and the orchestrator package, which it finds as the launcher does: a checkout, else the host-local install, else npx at the version pinned in `hosts/codex/package.json`. Starting it from a shell SHALL be the documented primary path, because a background process outliving an agent turn is unverified.
- It SHALL take `--runner <codex|opencode>`, with `codex` as the default so that an invocation without the flag behaves as before, and SHALL refuse any other kind. `--help` SHALL name the flag and its default. It SHALL take `--workers`, `--run-tag` and `--capacity`, and SHALL clamp the worker count to the capacity when one is given, logging the clamp. It SHALL find the daemon by `--url`, `ORCH_URL`, or the run directory of `--repo` (default: the current directory).
- It SHALL find the kind's runner module (`src/runner/<kind>.ts` under tsx in a checkout, else `dist/src/runner/<kind>.js`) and SHALL keep everything that differs by kind in one adapter per kind: the claim's settings block, `prepare` (the shim's inputs and the environment additions), `compose` (the shell command), whether a turn began, `parseUsage` and `classifyFailure`. Both adapters SHALL use the functions the runner modules export, so that a claimed launch and a spawned one are composed by the same code.
- It SHALL run one loop per worker in one process, starting the n-th loop's first claim (n-1)·300 ms late. Each loop SHALL claim over `POST /v1/claims` with `workerId <runTag>-<n>`, `access: "local"` and `runner` set to the chosen kind.
- For a codex claim the loop SHALL write the shim env file from the claim's `codex.env` and run `codex exec` in the claimed worktree, composed by `composeCodexCommand(launch, policy)` from the claim's `codex.settings`, `codex.maxWaitMs`, `model` and `effort`.
- For an opencode claim the loop SHALL build the per-launch config with `openCodeConfig(opencode.settings, opencode.allowedTools, opencode.maxWaitMs)`, write it through `prepareOpenCodeLaunch` (`.orchestrator/opencode.json`, 0600), and run `opencode run` in the claimed worktree, composed by `composeOpenCodeCommand(launch, policy)` from `opencode.settings`, `model` and `effort`. The environment SHALL carry the claim's `opencode.env` (from which the shim, an MCP child that inherits it, takes `ORCH_API`, `ORCH_LAUNCH_ID`, `ORCH_TOKEN`, `ORCH_RETRY_WINDOW_MS` and `ORCH_COMMIT_POLICY`) and the additions `prepareOpenCodeLaunch` returns: `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`, and `XDG_DATA_HOME` or `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` when the settings ask for them. No env file is written.
- Either way the loop process's own `ORCH_*` variables SHALL be dropped from the child environment. Stdin SHALL be a short preamble followed by the brief, redirected from `.orchestrator/<kind>-work-prompt.md`. The preamble SHALL name the launch, say that the orchestrator MCP server's tools carry its credentials (for opencode by their names `orchestrator_heartbeat`, `orchestrator_report`, `orchestrator_block`, `orchestrator_inbox`, `orchestrator_log`), say to stop on a 401, and say to retry rather than write a fallback report file. It SHALL carry the claim's `pending` question or answer when there is one.
- After the agent exits, the loop SHALL post the usage (codex: summed over `turn.completed` lines; opencode: summed over `step_finish` events by `parseOpenCodeUsage`) to `POST /v1/launches/:id/usage` with its worker id. When the launch is still held and running or waiting, the loop SHALL release it: with `keep: true` when the agent failed to start (codex: no turn began; opencode: no event, that is `exitBeforeTurn` or `startupContended`), and without keep when it ran but did not report. The release reason SHALL name the failure `classifyCodexFailure` or `classifyOpenCodeFailure` gave. After a `startupContended` release the loop SHALL wait between 0.5 and 1.5 s before it claims again.
- A loop SHALL stop when the run is finished or stalled; or when nothing is claimable for its kind (`claimableByKind.<kind>` is 0), no launch of that kind is live, and a question or review waits on a human; or when that quiet has lasted `--idle-exit-ms`. The log line SHALL name the kind. It SHALL also stop after `--max-failures` launches in a row that ended without the agent running or reporting; a contended start counts.
- While nothing is claimable a loop SHALL long-poll `GET /v1/events` instead of spinning. The poll SHALL be filtered to the `launch.claimable`, `launch.ended` and `launch.released` kinds, so that other loops' claim events do not wake it.
- On SIGINT or SIGTERM the process SHALL terminate its agent processes and release their launches with `keep: true`.
- The Codex host's run skill SHALL document the loop as the way to work a `pull` or `mixed` codex run, and the OpenCode host's run skill and README SHALL document `--runner opencode` as the way to work a `pull` or `mixed` opencode run.

#### Scenario: Two workers drain a graph
- **WHEN** `orchestrator-work --workers 2 --run-tag cx` runs against a three-task `pull` run with `runner.kind: codex`
- **THEN** every launch is claimed by `cx-1` or `cx-2` with `runner: "codex"` and has no pid, every task is done with one trailer commit per task on the integration branch, every launch row carries tokens with `usageSource: "worker"`, and both loops exit once the run is finished

#### Scenario: Codex fails to start
- **WHEN** the loop claims a launch and the `codex` executable exits before any turn starts
- **THEN** the launch is released with `keep: true`, the task returns to `unstarted` at no cost when nothing was touched, and after `--max-failures` such launches the loop stops

#### Scenario: Same command as a spawned launch
- **WHEN** a codex launch is claimed instead of spawned
- **THEN** the `codex exec` command differs from the Codex runner's only in the file fed to stdin

#### Scenario: Workers clamped to capacity
- **WHEN** the loop is started with `--workers 4 --capacity 2`
- **THEN** two loops run and the log says the count was clamped

#### Scenario: OpenCode launch claimed
- **WHEN** `orchestrator-work --runner opencode` claims a launch of a `pull` run with `runner.kind: opencode`
- **THEN** it runs `opencode run ... < .orchestrator/opencode-work-prompt.md` in the worktree with `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` in its environment, whose `mcp.orchestrator.command` is the shim and whose `permission` is `openCodePermission(settings.permission, allowedTools)` for the claim's `allowedTools`, and the launch row carries the usage of the `step_finish` events with `usageSource: "worker"`

#### Scenario: Contended OpenCode start
- **WHEN** the claimed `opencode run` exits with `database is locked` on stderr and no event
- **THEN** the loop logs `startupContended`, releases the launch with `keep: true` so the task returns to `unstarted` with no attempt charged, and claims again after a short back-off

#### Scenario: No launches of the kind
- **WHEN** `orchestrator-work --runner opencode` runs against a daemon whose claimable launches are all `codex`
- **THEN** it leaves them parked and exits once the quiet has lasted `--idle-exit-ms`, logging `nothing claimable for opencode`
