## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: MCP façade
A stdio MCP server launched per agent SHALL expose the five operations as tools, forward them to the HTTP API with the token from its environment, and retry through daemon restarts for the retry window before surfacing an error.

Started with `--orch-env-file <path>`, the façade SHALL layer the file's `KEY=VALUE` lines over its environment. When the file is missing or unreadable, it SHALL exit 1 with a message naming the path. The flag is not `--env-file`, because Node takes that flag from anywhere in argv.

The `report` tool's description SHALL state that a submit requires a committed, clean worktree only when `ORCH_COMMIT_POLICY` is unset or `agent`.

A runner whose CLI can treat an MCP server as optional or gate its tools behind approvals SHALL register the façade as required and with its tools pre-approved. For Codex this means `required=true`, plus the default and per-tool `approve` keys. OpenCode has no `required` analog (a server that cannot start is a warning and the run continues); its tools are named `orchestrator_<tool>` and are pre-approved by the permission rule `"orchestrator_*": "allow"`.

A runner whose CLI times out MCP calls SHALL size the tool timeout above `maxWaitMs`, so a `block` long-poll is not cut: Codex through `tool_timeout_sec`, OpenCode through `mcp.orchestrator.timeout` (its default is 60 000 ms).

#### Scenario: Daemon restart during a call
- **WHEN** the daemon is restarting while an agent calls the `report` tool
- **THEN** the façade retries until the daemon is back and the call succeeds within the retry window

#### Scenario: Report tool under daemon commits
- **WHEN** the façade starts with `ORCH_COMMIT_POLICY=daemon`
- **THEN** the `report` tool's description does not require a committed, clean worktree

#### Scenario: Env file
- **WHEN** the façade starts with `--orch-env-file` naming a file that holds the launch's variables, and none of them is in its environment
- **THEN** a `heartbeat` call is forwarded with the token from the file

#### Scenario: Env file missing
- **WHEN** the façade starts with `--orch-env-file` naming a file that does not exist
- **THEN** it exits 1 and stderr names the file

### Requirement: Agent environment
A launch the daemon spawns SHALL inherit the daemon's environment with these changes:
- `ORCH_HOME` replaced by a directory inside the run's data directory;
- `ORCH_URL`, `ORCH_REPO`, and `ORCH_DATA_DIR` removed;
- the agent variables `ORCH_LAUNCH_ID`, `ORCH_TOKEN`, `ORCH_API`, `ORCH_RETRY_WINDOW_MS`, `ORCH_TASK_ID`, and `ORCH_WORKTREE` added.

An orchestrator client the agent runs therefore SHALL find no run under its `ORCH_HOME` and SHALL NOT be able to start, stop, or list a daemon of the user's. `ORCH_API` SHALL remain set so the shim reaches the agent's own daemon.

An MCP server that the agent's CLI spawns SHALL be assumed to receive only what the runner forwards to it explicitly, unless the CLI is known to pass its whole environment on. Codex passes the server a fixed set of variables plus its `env` entries. OpenCode passes the MCP child its whole environment plus the server's `environment`, so the OpenCode runner SHALL forward nothing: it puts the shim's variables in the agent environment, registers the server with no `environment` block, and keeps the token off argv and out of every file. The runners SHALL build the shim's variables through one `shimEnv` helper.

#### Scenario: Agent sees an isolated home
- **WHEN** a spawned agent's command writes `$ORCH_HOME` to a file
- **THEN** the path is inside the run's data directory, not the user's `~/.orchestrator`, and `ORCH_URL` is unset in the agent's environment

#### Scenario: Agent cannot list the user's runs
- **WHEN** a spawned agent runs `orchestrator-ctl runs`
- **THEN** the result lists no runs
