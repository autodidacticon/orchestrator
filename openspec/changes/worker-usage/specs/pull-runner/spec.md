## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Worker usage
A claimed launch has no process for the daemon to observe and no log for a runner to read, so its worker SHALL be able to post the launch's usage after its agent exits: `POST /v1/launches/:id/usage` with `{ workerId, usage: { tokens, model?, costUsd? } }`, where `tokens` is `{ input, cachedInput?, cacheWriteInput?, output, reasoningOutput? }` of non-negative integers and `costUsd` is non-negative. The route SHALL be identified by the body like `/v1/claims` and the release route and SHALL NOT need the launch token, because by the time the worker has the usage the task is `submitted` and the launch may have ended. The daemon SHALL accept the post only for a launch that has a `worker` whose id equals `workerId`, has no pid, and is `live` or `ended`. Any other launch, including any launch with a pid, SHALL be refused with 409 and nothing recorded. A spawned launch's usage comes only from its runner. A malformed body SHALL be refused with 400. When the launch already has usage, the post SHALL be a no-op answered 200 with `recorded: false`. Otherwise the daemon SHALL store the usage with `source: 'worker'` as health-monitoring "Usage accounting" states, pricing tokens without a cost with the posted `model` or else the launch's model, and SHALL answer 200 with `recorded: true` and the cost when known. Self-reported usage is not authoritative; its provenance keeps it distinguishable.

#### Scenario: Worker posts usage after submit
- **WHEN** worker `w1` claims T1, submits, the launch ends with no usage, and `w1` posts `tokens: { input: 40361, output: 260 }`
- **THEN** the launch row records the tokens with `usageSource` `worker`, and one `launch.usage` with `source: 'worker'` is appended

#### Scenario: Second post is a no-op
- **WHEN** `w1` posts usage again for the same launch
- **THEN** the answer is 200 with `recorded: false`, the row is unchanged, and no `launch.usage` is appended

#### Scenario: Another worker or a spawned launch is refused
- **WHEN** `w2` posts usage for `w1`'s launch, or any worker posts usage for a launch with a pid
- **THEN** the answer is 409 and no usage is recorded

#### Scenario: Posted tokens are priced
- **WHEN** `budgets.prices` has the launch's model at 100 USD input and 1000 USD output per million tokens and `w1` posts 40361 input and 260 output tokens with no cost
- **THEN** the row records `costUsd` 4.2961 with `costSource` `priced`, and `status.cost.runUsd` includes it
